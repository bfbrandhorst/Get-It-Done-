# Get-It-Done-
A simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. When a user creates a new task with "title", "due date", and "description" a task card will appear in the column "To Do".  That acrd will be generated a color based on when the prject is due.  The card will change to yellow as a due date is approaching and red when the project is past due.  The task cards can be dragged and dropped into the different columns based on the user's progress on the task.  Once the task is completed the user simply clicks on the "delete" button on the specific card.
